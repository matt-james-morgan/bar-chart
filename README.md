Final Stretch Project For Lighthouse
##About
This is a prep project for the web dev flex program at lighthouse labs. This should give users options for customizing font size and colors, as well as graph values. 
This is supposed to be an api but I ended up making a miniature website.

##Functions
###Draw Bar Graph
This function will generate a bar graph. It takes three parametes. First the data the user has provided, secondly all the parameters for the visual components such as font color for the label, title size, title color etc..
###Regen
This function will reset all the parameters for the site and propmt user for more feedback.

##Features Needed
The UI needs to be improved. As well as stacked values into one bar

##Issues
I don't know what I need to do to make this a better API. Secondly I use vanilla javascript and jquery so I need to refactor it just to use jquery.
